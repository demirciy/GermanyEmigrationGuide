# Before Germany
You got the visa, congratulations again! Before coming to Germany, I would like to get your attention at some points.

### Accommadiation
  Keep in mind, that's not easy to find a house than where you are coming from. To make it easier and less stressful I highly recommend booking a house from a serviced apartment or Airbnb for the first month. It can be extended every end of the month until to find a house. 
  <br/><br/>**SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE: ASK YOUR LANDLORD IF YOU CAN DO "ANMELDUNG" WITH HIS/HER HOUSE**<br/><br/>
  Anmeldung: The address registration process that you have to do in 2 weeks from the date you arrived in Germany. I will explain the details about Anmeldung in the next section.
  <br/>Have a look at your office's location on Google Maps before booking a place. It provides you to think about transportation from home to the office or visa versa.
